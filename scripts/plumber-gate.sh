# Fails the job if the Plumber JSON report contains any Critical-severity
# finding. Plumber's own exit code reflects overall compliance against its
# score threshold, not per-finding severity, so this gates on
# plumberScore.counts.critical directly.
#
# A MISSING report is treated as a transient scan failure (warn, do not
# block), not a hard failure. plumber.yml runs the Plumber action with
# continue-on-error precisely so transient runtime errors (e.g. a rate-limited
# SLSA attestation check during a PR burst) never block merges; hard-failing
# here on a missing report would defeat that. A report that IS present and
# shows Critical findings still blocks.
